## Abstract

This SEP defines two server-authoritative, cryptographically signed records
for MCP tool calls: a **decision record** emitted by the governing server or
proxy before the side effect runs, and an **outcome record** emitted after
execution completes. The decision record binds what was requested, the policy
decision (allow, block, or escalate), and the risk basis for that decision. The
outcome record binds the execution status (`executed`, `refused`, or `errored`),
a commitment over the result, and timing. The two are paired through a
`backLink` and bound to the originating request, so a verifier can reconstruct
what the agent was permitted to do, why, and what it actually did.

These records are signed by the server or proxy that governs execution
(`issuerAsserted` / `receiptAsserted`), which is a different trust surface from
the client-asserted attestation of the call in SEP-2787 and the client-asserted
input audit context in SEP-2817. The records use RFC 8785 (JCS) canonical JSON,
a detached signature that does not cover itself, and are offline-verifiable by a
standard-library checker. The wire schema is the shape already shipping in the
Vaara MCP proxy (`vaara.attestation.receipt`), which also provides an
independent verifier and JCS conformance vectors.

## Motivation

EU AI Act Article 12 obliges providers and deployers of high-risk AI systems to
keep automatic records of events ("logs") over the system's lifetime, including
records adequate to identify situations that may cause the system to present a
risk and to support post-market monitoring under Article 72. For an
agentic MCP deployment, the regulator's question is not only "what did the
client claim it wanted to do" but "what did the governing system decide, on what
basis, and what did the tool call actually do." That is a statement the server
or governance layer must make, because it is the party that holds the decision
logic and observes the result.

SEP-2787 standardizes a signed attestation of a tool **call**: it binds the
agent identity, tool name, intent, and an argument commitment into a verifiable
envelope. SEP-2817 standardizes optional, explicitly non-authoritative,
**client-asserted** input audit context (`invocationReason`, `model`,
`userIntent`, `turnId`). Both describe the input side: what was claimed, by the
party making the call. Neither carries the governing system's decision or the
recorded outcome. SEP-2817 says so directly: "server-side decision records,
stable tool-call identity, agent/session correlation, and taxonomies are left to
follow-up SEPs," and Discussion #2704 frames the server-authoritative record as
the deferred half. This SEP is that follow-up.

Client-asserted records alone cannot satisfy Article 12 for a deployment where
the server enforces policy. A client can claim its intent and its arguments; it
cannot credibly attest that the call was allowed, why it was allowed or blocked,
or what the tool returned, because it does not own that logic and is not a
neutral observer of its own behavior. A regulator auditing an incident needs a
record signed by the enforcement point, paired to the request it answers, that
survives the client. Without a standard for that record, every governance vendor
invents an incompatible one, and cross-implementation verification (the point of
a conformance test) is impossible.

The records are also the natural place to satisfy the rest of the Article 12 and
Article 14 surface that input audit does not reach: the allow/block/escalate
decision (human-oversight evidence under Article 14), the risk basis that drove
it (risk-management evidence under Article 9), and the post-execution outcome
that feeds post-market monitoring (Article 72). A shipping implementation already
emits all of these as audit events; this SEP standardizes the signed wire shape
so they are portable and independently verifiable.

## Specification

### Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

- **Governing server**: the MCP server, or a proxy in front of it, that decides
  whether a tool call runs and observes the result. It is the issuer of both
  records defined here.
- **Decision record**: a signed envelope emitted before the side effect,
  carrying the policy decision and its risk basis.
- **Outcome record**: a signed envelope emitted after execution, carrying the
  execution status and a result commitment.
- **Request attestation**: the SEP-2787 envelope describing the tool call. It is
  the anchor both records point back to.

### Trust boundary

This SEP is server-authoritative. Both records are signed under the governing
server's key and place their bound claims in an issuer block
(`issuerAsserted` for the decision record, `receiptAsserted` for the outcome
record), mirroring the SEP-2787 trust-surface split. The records make claims
about the **decision** and the **execution**, which only the enforcement point
can make.

This is distinct from SEP-2787, where the issuer attests the **call** (identity,
tool, args) and the planner declares intent, and from SEP-2817, where the client
asserts input context that is explicitly not authorization evidence. A verifier
MUST treat the three as separate surfaces: a SEP-2787 attestation and a SEP-2817
`_meta` block describe what was asked for; the records in this SEP describe what
the governing system did about it. A server MUST NOT copy client-asserted
SEP-2817 fields into the signed decision or outcome record in a way that implies
the server vouches for their truth; it MAY reference them by `turnId` for
correlation (see Pairing).

### Canonicalization and signature

Both records use RFC 8785 (JCS) canonical JSON. The signature is computed over
the JCS-canonical encoding of the record's blocks **excluding** the `signature`
field, and the `signature` field carries the result; it does not cover itself.
This is identical to the SEP-2787 and the shipped Vaara execution-receipt scheme,
so a verifier that already handles SEP-2787 signatures handles these records with
no new cryptographic code.

- The `alg` field MUST be one of `ES256`, `RS256`, or `HS256`. Production
  deployments crossing a trust boundary SHOULD use an asymmetric algorithm
  (`ES256` or `RS256`) so verifiers need only the public key.
- IEEE-754 floats MUST NOT appear anywhere in a canonicalized body. Numeric
  values that are not integers MUST be encoded as scaled integers or decimal
  strings. This removes the most common source of cross-stack signature drift
  and matches the Vaara JCS discipline.
- All digests are encoded as the string `sha256:<lowercase-hex>`.
- All timestamps are RFC 3339 / ISO 8601 UTC strings with second precision and a
  trailing `Z` (for example `2026-05-31T09:30:00Z`).

### Argument and result commitments

Both records reuse the SEP-2787 commitment shapes verbatim. A commitment is one
of:

- **`ArgsRef`**: a content-addressed reference, `{ "ref": "<uri>", "digest":
  "sha256:<hex>", "canonicalization": "jcs" }`. The verifier MAY fetch `ref` and
  check the digest.
- **`ArgsProjection`**: a reviewed projection, `{ "projection": "<jcs-string>",
  "projectionDigest": "sha256:<hex>" }`, where `projection` is the JCS-canonical
  encoding of the projection object as a UTF-8 string and `projectionDigest` is
  the sha256 over those bytes.

Commitment-only audit, where the payload never leaves the server, is expressed as
a hash-only-identity `ArgsProjection` whose `projection` is the JCS encoding of
`{ "digest": "sha256:<hex>" }` and whose embedded digest binds the underlying
value. This is the shipped `make_args_digest` behavior and is the RECOMMENDED
default for the outcome record's `resultCommitment` so that results, which may
contain personal data, are committed to without being copied into the record.

### Decision record

A decision record MUST be emitted by the governing server before the tool call's
side effect runs, for every governed call. It is a JSON object with the
following top-level fields.

| Field            | Type     | Required | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`        | integer  | yes      | Record schema version. `1` for this SEP.                                    |
| `alg`            | string   | yes      | `ES256`, `RS256`, or `HS256`.                                               |
| `backLink`       | object   | yes      | Join to the SEP-2787 attestation (see below).                               |
| `decisionDerived`| object   | yes      | The decision and its risk basis (see below).                                |
| `issuerAsserted` | object   | yes      | The governing server's issuer block (see below).                            |
| `signature`      | string   | yes      | Detached signature over the JCS body excluding `signature`.                 |

**`backLink`** joins the decision to the request attestation it governs:

| Field              | Type   | Required | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `attestationDigest`| string | yes      | `sha256:<hex>` over the JCS-canonical full SEP-2787 attestation wire bytes, signature included. Pins the exact attestation instance. |
| `attestationNonce` | string | yes      | Echoes the attestation's `issuerAsserted.nonce` for fast correlation.                |

If no SEP-2787 attestation exists for the call (the deployment does not run
2787), the server MUST instead bind the request by setting `attestationDigest` to
`sha256:<hex>` over the JCS-canonical encoding of the request envelope it
observed (the `tools/call` params plus `_meta`), and set `attestationNonce` to a
server-chosen per-call nonce. The binding is to the request **instance**, not
only its content.

**`decisionDerived`** carries the decision and the basis for it:

| Field             | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `decision`        | string  | yes      | One of `allow`, `block`, `escalate`.                                                              |
| `reason`          | string  | no       | Short human-readable basis for the decision.                                                      |
| `riskScore`       | string  | no       | The risk estimate that drove the decision, as a decimal string (floats are prohibited on the wire). |
| `thresholdAllow`  | string  | no       | The allow threshold in force at decision time, as a decimal string.                              |
| `thresholdBlock`  | string  | no       | The block threshold in force at decision time, as a decimal string.                              |
| `policyId`        | string  | no       | Identifier or digest of the policy/ruleset version that produced the decision.                   |
| `decidedAt`       | string  | yes      | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp of the decision.                                                          |

A `decision` of `escalate` means the call was held for human oversight; the
outcome record for that call will report `refused` if the human declined, or a
later decision record MAY supersede it (see Pairing).

**`issuerAsserted`** is the governing server's signed block:

| Field          | Type    | Required | Description                                                            |
| -------------- | ------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `iss`          | string  | yes      | Issuer identity (the governing server or proxy).                      |
| `sub`          | string  | yes      | Subject the decision is about (tenant, agent, or upstream identity).  |
| `iat`          | string  | yes      | ISO 8601 UTC issuance time.                                           |
| `nonce`        | string  | yes      | Unique per record.                                                    |
| `secretVersion`| string  | yes      | Key/secret version identifier for rotation and dispatch.              |
| `alg`          | string  | yes      | MUST equal the top-level `alg`.                                       |

### Outcome record

An outcome record MUST be emitted by the governing server after the governed call
completes (or is refused), and MUST be paired to a decision record for the same
call. It is a JSON object with the following top-level fields. This is the shape
already shipping as `vaara.attestation.receipt.ExecutionReceipt`.

| Field            | Type     | Required | Description                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`        | integer  | yes      | Record schema version. `1`.                                         |
| `alg`            | string   | yes      | `ES256`, `RS256`, or `HS256`.                                       |
| `backLink`       | object   | yes      | Same shape as the decision record's `backLink`; pins the request.   |
| `outcomeDerived` | object   | yes      | Execution status, timing, and result commitment (see below).        |
| `receiptAsserted`| object   | yes      | The governing server's issuer block (same shape as `issuerAsserted`, minus `expSeconds`; an outcome record is a durable record, not a capability, so it carries no `exp` and verifiers enforce no TTL). |
| `signature`      | string   | yes      | Detached signature over the JCS body excluding `signature`.         |

**`outcomeDerived`** carries what happened:

| Field              | Type   | Required | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `status`           | string | yes      | One of `executed`, `refused`, `errored`.                                             |
| `completedAt`      | string | yes      | ISO 8601 UTC completion (or refusal) time.                                           |
| `resultCommitment` | object | no       | An `ArgsRef` or `ArgsProjection` over the result (executed) or error object (errored). Absent for `refused`, which has no result. RECOMMENDED to use the commitment-only hash-only-identity projection so result payloads, which may contain personal data, are not copied into the record. |

### Pairing

A decision record and an outcome record describe the same governed call when
both carry the same `backLink` (`attestationDigest` and `attestationNonce`
equal). A verifier that has both, plus the SEP-2787 attestation, can confirm the
full chain: the attestation pins the call; the decision record pins the policy
verdict and risk basis for that call; the outcome record pins what the call did.
This is instance-binding, not only content-binding: two byte-identical calls
produce two attestations with distinct nonces and therefore distinct
`attestationDigest` values, so a decision or outcome record cannot be replayed
against a different instance of the same call.

For correlation with client-asserted input context (SEP-2817), a server MAY
include the SEP-2817 `turnId` as an additional, clearly client-asserted field
inside `decisionDerived` under the key `clientTurnId`. This is correlation only;
its presence in the signed body means the server records that the client claimed
this `turnId`, not that the server vouches for it.

A superseding decision (for example, a human resolving an `escalate`) is recorded
as a new decision record with the same `backLink` and a later `decidedAt`. The
record with the latest `decidedAt` for a given `backLink` is the effective
decision; earlier ones are retained as history. Verifiers MUST NOT treat
multiple decision records for one `backLink` as a conflict.

### Transport

The records are signed JSON objects and are transport-agnostic. A server MAY
return the outcome record in the `tools/call` response `_meta` under the reserved
key `io.modelcontextprotocol/executionRecord`, MAY return the decision record
under `io.modelcontextprotocol/decisionRecord`, and MAY persist either to an
out-of-band audit store. When a record is too large to carry inline (a large
`ArgsRef` chain), the server SHOULD return an `ArgsRef` pointing to the stored
record. This SEP does not require any change to existing MCP message formats; the
records ride in `_meta`, consistent with SEP-414, SEP-2787, and SEP-2817.

### Verification algorithm

A verifier holding a decision record, an outcome record, the SEP-2787
attestation, and the governing server's public key (or shared secret for HS256)
MUST perform, and a conforming implementation MUST pass, the following checks:

1. For each record, recompute the JCS-canonical encoding of the body with the
   `signature` field removed, and verify `signature` under the issuer key for the
   record's `alg`. Reject on mismatch.
2. Recompute `attestationDigest` from the SEP-2787 attestation wire bytes and
   confirm both records' `backLink.attestationDigest` and
   `backLink.attestationNonce` match it. Reject on mismatch.
3. Confirm the two records share the same `backLink` (they describe the same
   call).
4. If `resultCommitment` is present and the verifier has the result payload,
   recompute the commitment digest from the runtime result and confirm it
   matches. Reject on mismatch.
5. Confirm `decisionDerived.decision` is one of `allow`, `block`, `escalate` and
   `outcomeDerived.status` is one of `executed`, `refused`, `errored`.

## Rationale

**Two records, not one.** The decision and the outcome are made at different
times by the same party and answer different regulatory questions (Article 9 and
14 risk and oversight evidence versus Article 72 post-market outcome evidence). A
single combined record would force the server to delay signing until after
execution, losing the pre-side-effect commitment that proves the verdict was
fixed before the action ran. Splitting them, paired by `backLink`, preserves the
commit-before-execute property that is the whole point of an enforcement record.

**Instance-binding over content-binding.** Earlier drafts in the #2704 / #2817
discussion considered binding records to the content hash of the call alone. That
lets a record be replayed against any byte-identical call. Binding to the
SEP-2787 attestation digest (signature included) pins the exact attestation
instance, so distinct calls with identical content still produce distinct
bindings. This was the resolved position in discussion; the agent-guard author
conceded the instance-binding point on 2026-05-30, and this SEP adopts it as
normative.

**Reusing the SEP-2787 stack.** The outcome record is the post-execution sibling
of the SEP-2787 attestation and deliberately reuses its canonicalization, signing
algorithms, commitment shapes, and issuer-block layout. A verifier that handles
SEP-2787 handles these records with no new cryptographic code, and the decision
record adds only one new block (`decisionDerived`).

**Why server-authoritative.** A client cannot credibly attest a decision it did
not make or an outcome it is not a neutral observer of. SEP-2787 and SEP-2817
cover the input side precisely because they are client or issuer claims about the
call. The enforcement record has to come from the enforcement point, which is why
this is a separate SEP rather than an extension of either.

**Alternatives considered.** Carrying the decision inside the SEP-2787
`issuerAsserted` block was rejected because SEP-2787 attests the call, not the
verdict, and overloading it would blur the trust surface that SEP made explicit.
Adopting AlgoVoi's content-addressed `action_ref` as the primary binding field
was rejected: a content-addressed receipt id is a useful secondary index but is
content-binding, and using it as the primary join reintroduces the replay
problem instance-binding solves. The `action_ref` style is reconcilable as an
optional `ArgsRef`-shaped pointer, not as the default join.

## Backward Compatibility

This SEP introduces no breaking changes. Both records are new, optional `_meta`
payloads under reserved keys; servers that do not emit them and clients that do
not consume them are unaffected. The schema reuses the SEP-2787 commitment and
issuer-block shapes, so an existing SEP-2787 verifier extends to these records by
adding the `decisionDerived` block and the `outcomeDerived.status` enum, with no
change to the canonicalization or signature code. The records do not alter any
existing MCP request or response method.

## Security Implications

**Signing-key compromise and post-hoc backdating.** A signed record proves the
holder of the key bound those values, but a compromised key lets an adversary
mint records with any `decidedAt` / `completedAt` they choose, including
backdated ones, to fabricate a clean history. A signature alone cannot defeat
this. The defense is an **external time anchor**: periodically anchoring the head
of the append-only audit chain that carries these records to an independent,
trusted timestamp (an RFC 3161 timestamp token, or an eIDAS qualified electronic
timestamp) so that records signed after a compromise cannot be inserted before
the last anchored head without detection. The Vaara reference implementation
binds each record into a hash chain today (chain version 2, with tenant identity
bound into the chained hash), and the external-anchor mechanism is the next
shipped step (Vaara v0.48). A conforming deployment under EU AI Act retention
obligations SHOULD anchor the chain head externally at a cadence proportionate to
its risk.

**Replay.** Instance-binding through the SEP-2787 attestation digest (signature
included) plus the per-record `nonce` means a record cannot be replayed against a
different call instance. Verifiers MUST reject a record whose `backLink` does not
match the attestation under verification.

**Instance versus content binding.** As above, binding is to the attestation
instance, not only the call content. Implementations MUST NOT substitute a bare
content hash of the arguments for the `attestationDigest`, because that
reintroduces replay across byte-identical calls.

**Personal data minimization.** Tool arguments and results can contain personal
data. The RECOMMENDED default for both `decisionDerived` (which never copies the
arguments, only a risk basis and decision) and `outcomeDerived.resultCommitment`
(commitment-only hash-only-identity projection) is that the record commits to a
digest of the value without copying the value. Where a reviewed projection is
needed for audit, servers SHOULD redact to the minimum fields necessary and
commit to the projection, never the raw payload. This keeps the signed,
long-retained record free of personal data while preserving the ability to prove,
given the original value out of band, that it is the one the record committed to.
This aligns with GDPR data minimization and storage limitation alongside the
Article 12 retention obligation.

**Issuer identity and key distribution.** Verifiers must obtain the governing
server's public key out of band; embedding a public key in the record is a
convenience for local verification only and is not trust-establishing. The
`secretVersion` field supports key rotation; verifiers dispatch on it.

**Denial of service.** Record emission MUST NOT block legitimate traffic; a
governing server that cannot sign SHOULD fail closed on the **decision** (do not
allow an ungoverned call) but record the signing failure, and MAY degrade outcome
recording to a logged error rather than dropping the call's result. The reference
implementation emits records on a best-effort path that never blocks the proxied
call and counts emission failures for operator alerting.

## Prior Art Reconciled

- **SEP-2787 (Tool call attestation, author soup-oss, Extensions Track, open).**
  Attests the tool **call**: planner-declared intent, issuer-asserted identity,
  payload-derived tool bindings and argument commitment. This SEP is its
  post-decision and post-execution counterpart and reuses its canonicalization,
  signing, commitment shapes, and trust-surface layout. The `backLink` pins a
  SEP-2787 attestation. The split between what was asked (2787) and what was
  decided and done (this SEP) is deliberate and preserves 2787's trust surface.

- **SEP-2817 (AI Invocation Audit Context in Request `_meta`, author hangum,
  Standards Track, draft seeking sponsor).** Standardizes optional,
  client-asserted input audit context (`invocationReason`, `model`, `userIntent`,
  `turnId`) and states explicitly that these fields are not authorization
  evidence and that server-side decision records are left to a follow-up SEP.
  This is that follow-up. Correlation with 2817 is by optionally recording the
  client-asserted `turnId` as `clientTurnId`, clearly marked as a client claim.

- **agent-guard (XuebinMa, Rust).** Models a `Guard` producing an `AuditRecord`
  and an `ExecutionProof`. The two-record decision/outcome split here covers the
  same ground as `AuditRecord` plus `ExecutionProof`, with the binding made
  explicit and instance-scoped through the SEP-2787 attestation digest rather
  than left to a content hash. The instance-binding position was conceded by the
  agent-guard author in discussion on 2026-05-30 and is adopted here as
  normative.

- **AlgoVoi / chopmob-cloud `action_ref` and `draft-hopley-x402-compliance-receipt`.**
  Defines a content-addressed receipt identifier `action_ref = sha256(JCS(...))`.
  This SEP does not adopt `action_ref` as the default join field, because a
  content-addressed id is content-binding and reintroduces cross-instance replay
  when used as the primary binding. A content-addressed pointer is reconcilable
  as an optional `ArgsRef`-shaped reference (the `ref` carries such an id and the
  `digest` pins it), not as the normative pairing key, which remains the
  instance-scoped `backLink`.

## Reference Implementation

The wire schema in this SEP is the shape shipping in the Vaara MCP proxy
(v0.47; the receipt library landed in v0.42). Relevant modules:

- `vaara/attestation/_receipt_types.py`: the `ExecutionReceipt` envelope
  (`version`, `alg`, `backLink`, `outcomeDerived`, `receiptAsserted`,
  `signature`), `OutcomeDerived` with `status` constrained to `executed` /
  `refused` / `errored`, and `BackLink` (`attestationDigest`,
  `attestationNonce`). This is the outcome record of this SEP, byte for byte.
- `vaara/attestation/_receipt_emit.py`: builds, JCS-canonicalizes (signing input
  excludes `signature`), and signs the outcome record; verifies the signature.
- `vaara/attestation/_receipt_verifier.py`: `make_back_link` / `verify_back_link`
  and `attestation_digest` (sha256 over the JCS-canonical full SEP-2787 wire
  bytes, signature included): the instance-binding join.
- `vaara/attestation/_sep2787_types.py` and `_sep2787_canonical.py`: the shared
  commitment shapes (`ArgsRef`, `ArgsProjection`, `make_args_digest`), the
  issuer-block layout, RFC 8785 canonicalization with float rejection, and the
  signing stack (`ES256` / `RS256` / `HS256`) reused unchanged.
- `vaara/integrations/_mcp_attest.py` and `mcp_proxy.py`: the proxy emits the
  SEP-2787 attestation before the call and the paired outcome record after it,
  on a best-effort path that never blocks proxied traffic.
- `vaara/audit/trail.py`: the append-only, hash-chained audit trail the records
  are written into; chain version 2 binds `tenant_id` and `chain_version` into
  the chained hash so a record cannot be silently re-attributed to another
  tenant. The external time anchor over the chain head (Security Implications) is
  the next shipped step (v0.48).

**Implementation gap (decision record).** The pre-execution **decision** is today
emitted as an audit event and as a SHA-256 commit-outcome receipt pair
(`vaara/audit/receipts.py`: `CommitPayload` with `decision`, `risk_score`,
`threshold_allow`, `threshold_deny`, `decided_at`, and `OutcomePayload`), but as
a hash-chained pair rather than as a signed envelope in the SEP-2787 issuer-block
shape. The `decisionDerived` block in this SEP standardizes that content as a
signed envelope and is the part of the reference implementation that lands
alongside this SEP. The field mapping is direct: `decision` to `decision`,
`risk_score` to `riskScore`, `threshold_allow` to `thresholdAllow`,
`threshold_deny` to `thresholdBlock`, `decided_at` to `decidedAt`.

## Test Vectors

The Vaara conformance vectors for the SEP-2787 canonicalization and signature
(`modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol#2789`) cover the JCS encoding, float
rejection, and the detached-signature scheme that both records in this SEP reuse.
A standard-library-only checker (no Vaara import; `cryptography` for the
asymmetric case) verifies a signed export offline, mirroring the
`scripts/verify_vaara_trail.py` approach. For Standards Track finalization, this
SEP will add:

- JCS canonical vectors for the `decisionDerived` block and the
  `outcomeDerived.status` enum, in the same vector format as #2789.
- A paired decision-plus-outcome fixture with its SEP-2787 attestation, exercising
  the full verification algorithm above, including a replay-rejection case
  (mismatched `backLink`) and a superseding-decision case (two decision records,
  same `backLink`, distinct `decidedAt`).
- A `sep-XXXX.yaml` traceability file mapping each MUST / MUST NOT and
  SHOULD / SHOULD NOT in the Specification to a conformance check ID, as required
  for Standards Track SEPs reaching Final.

## Acknowledgments

This proposal builds directly on SEP-2787 (soup-oss) and SEP-2817 (hangum), and
on the server-authoritative record direction set out in Discussion #2704. The
instance-binding versus content-binding discussion with the agent-guard author
(XuebinMa) shaped the normative pairing rule.
